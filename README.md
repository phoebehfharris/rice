## Install

After installing the dependencies listed above, clone the git page and run the install.bash script. 

The pull.bash script is just something I use for syncing changes I make to the configs locally so I can have them in one place. 


If you want to uninstall, just run the uninstall.bash script, which will remove the commands from path. 

## Use

The changeColor.bash script is used to switch themes, and can be invoked as a command (is installed to /usr/local/bin), as well as being invoked with the Mod+Shift+[Arrow Key] keybind in AwesomeWM. 

Use Mod+Shift+Left and Right keys to cycle themes, Mod+Shift+Down to pick a random theme and Mod+Shift+Up to pick a new wallpaper for the current theme.
